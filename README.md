# 🔍 NextSploit: Next.js CVE-2025-29927 Scanner & Exploiter ⚠️

**NextSploit** is a command-line tool designed to detect and exploit **CVE-2025-29927**, a security flaw in Next.js. The tool first identifies if a target website is running Next.js and determines whether its version falls within the vulnerable range. If the website is confirmed to be vulnerable, the tool **automatically attempts to exploit the issue** by bypassing middleware protections, potentially granting unauthorized access to restricted pages.

---

## 🚀 **Features**

- **🔍 Automated Next.js Version Detection**: Uses Wappalyzer to check if the target website runs Next.js and retrieves its version.
- **🛡️ Vulnerability Assessment**: Determines if the detected version is within the known vulnerable range.
- **⚔️ Middleware Exploitation Test**: Attempts to exploit the **CVE-2025-29927** vulnerability using middleware headers.
- **🌐 Automated Chrome Browser Launch**: Opens the target URL with necessary headers preconfigured to bypass authentication (if vulnerable).
- **📡 Mass URL Scanning**: Allows scanning of multiple URLs simultaneously.
